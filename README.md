# RedditGiveawayProgram

This program will determine two winners of two separate Reddit giveaways.
Each giveaway had its own unique username CSV for those who respectively signed up.

NOTE: If you are interested in the portion of the code that decides a random winner, you really only need to focus on the `Users.java` file (specifically, the `getWinningUser()` method) in the **src** directory â€” everything else is essentially "helper" code.
