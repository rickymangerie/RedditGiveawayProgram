# TameImpalaGiveawayProgram

This program will determine two winners of a Reddit giveaway being run on the r/TameImpala sub.

NOTE: If you are interested in the portion of the code that decides a random winner, you really only need to focus on the `Users.java` and `Main.java` files in the **src** directory â€” everything else is essentially "helper" code.
